Announcement Feature Walkthrough

# Announcements

Announcements are messages sent to students by staff members. These announcements can be directed to any `group` that the staff member is in and can only be read by students in that group. When an announcement is sent, students in that group can click on the announcement in the announcements page and read the announcement. Once they have finished reading it, they are to press the `Mark as Read` button at the bottom of the announcement. Meanwhile, staff are able to see who has read the announcement by scrolling down to see a list of bluetickers. The list contains details about the students' username, name and date read.

## Formatting

We initially debated over whether to use Rich Text Format or Markdown. However, due to time constraints and its ease of use, we chose to use `Marked`, a Github-flavoured Markdown renderer for our announcements. Markdown has many features and has a gentle learning curve, meaning that teachers can use it quickly and to their desired effect.
